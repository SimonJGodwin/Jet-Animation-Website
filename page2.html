<div class="backgroundbox"><p class="fade-in-text">  1. The F-35B is the world's only stealth Short Take Off/Vertical Landing airplane that can accelerate to supersonic speeds. In fact, it can reach speeds of 1.6 Mach (~1,200 mph) even with a full internal weapons load. This enables Marines to be effective in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.<br>
    <br>
    2. The supersonic, multi-role F-35 represents a quantum leap in air dominance capability with enhanced lethality and survivability in hostile, anti-access airspace environments. ... The F-35 is designed with the entire battlespace in mind, bringing new flexibility and capability to the United States and its allies.<br>
<br>
3. It takes 58,000 man hours to build each F-35B.<br>
<br>
4. The F-35 can launch from land, and will take off from HMS Queen Elizabeth via the skip jump ramp, which has been designed to optimise the launch.<br>
<br>
5. All variants of the jets are mainly constructed on Lockheed Martin’s mile-long production line in Fort Worth, Texas.<br>
<br>
6. There are six distributed aperture system sensors around the jet – two underneath, two on top of the aircraft and one either side of the nose. These infrared cameras feed real-time information and images into the pilot’s helmet, allowing them to see through the airframe.<br>
<br>
7. The UK’s supersonic aircraft have been based in the US since their manufacture.<br>
<Br>
8. The F-35B jets are built from more than 300,000 individual parts.<br>
<br>
9. Britain has committed to a £9.1 billion programme to buy 48 of the jets by 2025 – with a pledge to purchase 138 – they will be jointly operated by Royal Air Force and Royal Navy pilots.<br>
<br>
10. Maximum thrust tops 40,000lb and the jet has a range of 900 nautical miles.</p></div>
